# Heart-Disease-Classification
## Prediction of Heart disease based on 14 features using Machine Learning


The dataset we used have a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease.
The library Matplotlib is used to visualize the data in various forms.
The code uses SVM model to predict the presence/absence of the condition, with *83.34%* accuracy.
